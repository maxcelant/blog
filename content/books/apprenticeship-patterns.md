Start by writing down five things you don't know. Then, use tests as a method to explore and learn a new language. Choose a primary language and deliberately push beyond your usual scope with it—don't just stay in your comfort zone. As you do this, become idiomatic in that language; immerse yourself until your usage feels natural and native.

Adopt a “white belt” mindset—embrace your ignorance and don’t pretend to know what you don’t. Expertise isn't the goal; it’s a byproduct of consistent, long-term effort. Keep learning and actively seek out areas where you’re weak. Pick one specific skill, tool, or technique and dig deep to close your knowledge gaps.

Growth comes from discomfort. Take on jobs that scare you and push your limits. Use feedback loops to keep projects alive and evolving. One effective strategy is to reimplement something you already know well—it forces a deeper understanding.

Remember that a craftsman's job is to build things that serve others. It’s not about self-expression, though beauty can emerge from the work. Study the classics; they'll give you perspective and inspiration when you hit dull stretches. Having a title means nothing—apprenticeship never truly ends.

Strive to be the weakest person on the team. That’s where real learning happens. The fear of being rejected by a mentor is usually exaggerated—most want to help. Seek out a community that shares your values and ambitions. Don’t shy away from menial tasks on important projects; these are opportunities to prove your competence and earn trust.

Stop getting distracted by pointless things. Instead, get intimately familiar with your weaknesses. There’s a crucial balance to strike between learning and producing—too much of either can be a trap.

Build toy systems that reflect the real-world systems you deal with; it’ll sharpen your intuition. Read other people’s code and get good—really good—at understanding it. Pick a demanding open-source project, dissect it, learn how it's built, and document what you discover.

Make it a habit to revisit your old notes. The less skilled you are, the more you’ll overestimate your ability. Don’t let your team’s perception of you distort your self-awareness. And finally, understand that expertise can be a trap. True understanding comes when you reconstruct the original context in which an idea was born.
