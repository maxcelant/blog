title: Hi, I'm MaxðŸ‘‹

My name is Massimiliano (Max), I currently work at American Airlines as a Platform Engineer on the Kubernetes as a Platform team.
More specifically, I work on the Kubernetes operators squad where we help support over 300 American Airlines applications.

I like to dive into different tech related topics on my free time and read technical books. I'm going to use this space to expand on my 
learning and dive into interesting topics I want to get a better grasp of. 

I'm not anti-AI, but I won't be using it to assist my writing. I feel like that defeats the purpose of writing a blog.
